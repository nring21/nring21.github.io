## About Me

Hello! My name is Noah Ring, and I'm a physics Ph.D. student studying 
high energy theory. I'm primarily studying non-perturbative QFT and CFTs, 
but I think lots more is interesting too!  
  
My publications can be found on 
[INPIRE-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/2955116?ui-citation-summary=true).
