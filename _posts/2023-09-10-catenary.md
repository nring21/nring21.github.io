## The Catenary

I've recently spent some time applying the calculus of variations to the classic problem of the catenary. For the uninitiated, the catenary is the curve that will be formed by hanging some rope or chain between two poles.

We often see this form in our everyday lives, be it telephone wires of rope barriers meant to section off different areas. Given its ubiquity in the day-to-do, one might assume that the catenary is a trivial problem to consider. However, this turns out to not be the case, and in fact has rich physical and mathematical content.

In the end however, it was not the physical content that has driven me to share this problem. Instead, it is due to the mathematical elegance that falls out during the process. I hope you will share in my appreciation for what follows.

As a final note, my work toward a solution will assume familiarity with standard calculus and the calculus of variations.

## The Problem

We consider a chain of mass density \\(\rho\\) and length \(\ell\) hanging from hooks fixed to the top of two poles a distance of \(\frac{\ell}{2}\) apart. Further, we assume that we are working in a uniform gravitational field with gravitational acceleration $g$ and we fix the poles at \(x=\pm\frac{\ell}{4}\). We then define the height, \(y\), at which the chain is fixed to the poles as \(y=0\).

We now would like to define a functional for the potential energy so that we may minimize it, as our expectation is for the catenary to be the configuration which is energetically favorable (i.e. minimized).

We can intuitively consider cutting up the chain into infinitesimal slices of mass, \(dm\), such that summing over all of the infinitesimal pieces yields the total mass. This is equivalent to considering an infinitesimal length piece of the chain, which comes with some fixed density, and then summing up over the whole length to get the total mass. Hence, we have \(dm = \rho ds\). Using this idea to define gravitational potential energy, we have 

\begin{equation}U = \int ds \rho g y.\end{equation}
