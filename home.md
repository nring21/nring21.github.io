Welcome! 

This is just a place for me to share my thoughts and informations about myself. Feel free to read on if you're interested in who I am or what I have to say.

## About Me

Hello! My name is Noah Ring, and I'm a first year Physics Ph.D. student studying theoretical physics. Obviously I really like physics, but I also really enjoy math and spending time thinking about how they click together.
